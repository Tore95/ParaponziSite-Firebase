# Paraponzi SteakHouse - Firebase Site
This is a simple site created by me for the Paraponzi SteakHouse. The project has been appropriately censored to cover the access data to the firebase api.

> **The site is online and functioning at the address: www.paraponzi.it**

## The Purpose
The idea behind the project was to create a site with all the information on the restaurant and a digital menu **as fast and light as possible**, without sacrificing the elegance and style of the restaurant.

## How it's built
The site is built **without the use of CMS**, only with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JQuery**, **Firebase API** and **Bootstrap** framework
